## My process

In my last project, I said I qas going to be doing lots of practise project using html and css. So I decided to do all HTML and CSS projets on freecodecamp(the free ones, lol), there are about 6 I think, hopefullt, I will be done by the end of the week.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first Approach

### What I learned

Like I said this is a practise project, so I mostly used what I knew before and did'nt learn much. I took longer than I expected idk why, it looked like something I could do in 2 hours but I ended up exceeding that😑

Ooh, I also tried the mobile first approach this time. If I should rate it out of ten, I'll say 7. lol Maybe with time, maybe with time.

### Continued development

I said I was going to start my Javascript course but I haven't. I plan on starting after I'm done with the html and css challenges on freecodecamp.

I also want to try a project with bootstrap and tailwind. I want to see how it feels. Hopefully, you'll see them being used in subsequent projects

I don't know why this project took me so long. Please do check my code and see if i did any unneccesary, sigh. I'll be really grateful.(You can send me a dm on twitter. Thanks)
